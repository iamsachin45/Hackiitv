# SmartAi
"We are introducing the System application similar to Google Meet with an extension of other functionalities.<br>
Our functionalities will help in following ways:-
1. It can help stop bullying of teachers in online classes by recording movements of students.
2. It will automatically mark the attendance of people using FaceNet paper algorithm which will save other's time.
3. It contains a dashboard like system that takes less bandwidth and will share coordinates of designs and drawings in the pdf's that would be taught."

# Problem statement

The problem smartAi solves is now a days we have seen there are error in internet connectivity,  online pranks, time wastage and faulty attendance so we have proposed our implementation.

# Our solution

1. It can help stop bullying of teachers in online classes by recording movements of students.
2. It will automatically mark the attendance of people using FaceNet paper algorithm which will save other's time.
3. It contains a dashboard like system that takes less bandwidth and will share coordinates of designs and drawings in the pdf's that would be taught."
